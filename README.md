# Yet another JSON editor and formatter

The goal is to make available a simple but powerful stand-alone json editor to all. Useful to edit/format private and public data.

Try it here - [JSON Editor](https://mishra-ankit.github.io/jsoneditor-standalone/index.html)

If you're really paranoid about using online verions, you can to run it offline, without any outside dependencies, use the stand-alone editor and run it locally on your system.

#### Prerequisite :
[npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)

```
> npx jsoneditor-standalone
```
#### To install and run :

```
> npm i -g jsoneditor-standalone
> jsoneditor
```

A wrapper of [jsoneditor](https://github.com/josdejong/jsoneditor)
